Welcome to the new Apache Shiro Stormpath integration! This new release features a servlet plugin, plus deeper support for Spring and Spring Boot. Until now, we have only had a basic Apache Shiro realm for Stormpath. While sufficient, this basic realm never granted access to the full suite of Stormpath services. Today, that changed!
