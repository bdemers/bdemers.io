Last week we released Apache Shiro 1.3, and I shared a tutorial on the new Hazelcast support. Today, I’d like to introduce you to the new `EventBus` system and show you a couple different ways to use it. Shiro’s `EventBus` is implemented very similar to Guava’s `EventBus`, if you are already familiar with that, you already know how to use it.
