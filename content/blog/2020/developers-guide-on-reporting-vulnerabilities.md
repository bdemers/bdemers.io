Many of us are not familiar with vulnerability reporting and how it is different from reporting a regular bug. Frequently, Iâ€™ve seen people report vulnerabilities or potential security issues incorrectly. A public bug tracker or Stack Overflow is NOT the right tool; developers need to handle vulnerabilities differently and should not disclose them until the project/vendor fixes them.
