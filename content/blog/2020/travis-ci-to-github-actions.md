Recently, a colleague pointed out that I was still configuring Travis-CI on new GitHub repos and suggested I used GitHub Actions instead. I had given Actions the ol' five-minute test when it was still in beta, but ran into a few problems and gave up. After all, Iâ€™ve been a fan of Travis-CI for a while and I had enough new things to learn at the time.
