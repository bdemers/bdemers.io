REST endpoints are used just about everywhere you need to decouple your web service and client. Many developers have used Spring or JAX-RS for this purpose. Some have used one but not the other, in this post I’ll go over the the differences between the two using basically the same code. In future posts I’ll show you how easy it is to secure these REST endpoints using Apache Shiro and Stormpath. If you cannot wait until then, you can check out these examples right now.
