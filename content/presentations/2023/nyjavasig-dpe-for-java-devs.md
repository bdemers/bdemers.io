Sasquatch. Yeti. The Loch Ness Monster. The 10x Developer. You may think of these as mythical creatures that can’t possibly exist, but the 10x Organization is very real. In this session, Gradle’s Brian Demers will explain how a dedicated Developer Productivity Engineering (DPE) organization can breed 10x Developers. By reducing the toil, friction, and frustration of slow builds, flaky tests, and other avoidable failures, a DPE team enables a level of developer productivity that you may have thought impossible. Brian will help you explore DPE technologies, including build and test acceleration, failure analytics, and easily analyzed build records to show how to create an environment in which 10x Developers not only exist, but thrive.
