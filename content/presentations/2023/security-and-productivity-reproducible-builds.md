Reproducible builds are crucial for ensuring software integrity but can be challenging to achieve. On the other hand, build caches provide a way to speed up builds by reusing previously-built artifacts and dependencies.

This talk will explore how reproducible builds and build caches can work together to create a more efficient, secure, and enjoyable development workflow. We will discuss the benefits and challenges of reproducible builds and build caches and provide practical tips for implementation.

> **HINT:** If a build is reproducible, it's also cacheable!

Attendees will come away with a solid understanding of reproducible builds and build caches and how to implement them to achieve faster, more reliable, and more secure software builds.
