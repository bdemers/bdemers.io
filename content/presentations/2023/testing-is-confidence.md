We all know testing is important, but many of us still struggle with the difference between unit tests and integration tests and build cycles that take too long.

This talk will discuss, why we write tests, the different types of tests, and some best practices. Everything discussed will be language agnostic and discuss some common problems and solutions Iâ€™ve seen different shops, big and small.

The audience should walk away with a new appreciation for fast and clean builds.
